Learning Angular
===============

Trying to get better at angular using:
* [Thinkster.io](http://www.thinkster.io/angularjs/GtaQ0oMGIl/a-better-way-to-learn-angularjs)
* [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/)
* [Angular JS Book](http://www.amazon.com/AngularJS-Brad-Green/dp/1449344852/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1403027393&sr=8-2&keywords=angular+js)

#Overview:
Keeping track of my progress through the Thinkster Angular learning path

#How to use:
Probably not useful for anyone, unless you just want to dig through my code as a refrence point...most of it should be working. :)

Check out the sites listed in the first section...learning Angular doesn't have to be hard.
